# My Brave Home  

A fun, modern Brave browser homepage with a playful ghost bot, real-time widgets, and sleek glassmorphism design.  

## ✨ Highlights  
- **Ghost Bot**: Follows your cursor, reacts to clicks, and adapts to weather.  
- **Widgets**: Clock, live weather, quick links, and search bar.  
- **Design**: Clean, responsive UI with frosted glass effects and smooth animations.  
- **Lightweight**: Pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript—no dependencies.
